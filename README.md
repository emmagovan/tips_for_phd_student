 The tips and tricks I learned during my PhD

## Github
- Setting up a personal access code: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
- Save this access code and use it when you are promoted for the username or password. This is known as HTTPS section. You will need this if you want to git push or git commit from the terminal.
- SSH is a different process and requires a separate code
- Github desktop is great
- If you have very large files there is a limit on Github desktop of 100M. This can be overcome using the terminal. Check out: https://git-lfs.com/
- Maximum git push is 100M but every time you commit it saves it. If you commit a larger file and want to remove this commit later check out:
